Make a three of your own classes for objects (everyday objects are probably fine). What attributes does each one have? How do you know? Why did you pick those? Add getter and setter methods. Are there any private (non-public-facing) attributes? If so, what are they?

Here's your basic process:

Create a new (empty) repository on GitHub called w02-d01-classes
Clone it locally into your exercises folder
Make a lib directory and a tests directory
Add the following files, in whatever order:
In lib, your three classes (they're ruby files)
In the repository's root folder, a readme.md
Your readme should describe the three classes in brief.

Make sure to include getter and setter methods. If you want to, you can add additional methods.

Don't worry about writing tests yet. Just create the folder for it.
